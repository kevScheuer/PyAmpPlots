    "# How to Aggregate and Plot AmpTools .fit Results\n",
    "If you're here, you've most likely just finished running an amplitude analysis using the [AmpTools](https://github.com/mashephe/AmpTools) framework, and now you have a whole bunch of fit results, stored as `.fit` files, that you need to start plotting. Within this tutorial you will learn how to:\n",
    "1. Aggregate these fit and data files into flattened `.csv` files\n",
    "2. Load and plot the `.csv` fit results using python's pandas and matplotlib libraries\n",
    "   1. Analyze mass independent fit results across multiple bins of invariant mass\n",
    "   1. Analyze the distributions of several fit results within a mass bin\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned in the [repo's README](../README.md), this tutorial assumes you are already familiar with how AmpTools functions and conducts an amplitude analysis. Please note that this tutorial will *not* cover plotting the fit's angular distributions. This requires the full information of the `.root` files and is effectively handled by the [halld_sim plotter scripts](https://github.com/JeffersonLab/halld_sim/blob/master/src/programs/AmplitudeAnalysis/vecps_plotter/vecps_plotter.cc)\n",
